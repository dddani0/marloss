<h2>Hello, I'm Dániel!</h2>
 <br>
Videogames and programming are my main source of interest, but I also adore other forms of art, like writing, drawing, composing!
 <br>
I wish to share my emotions, feelings and thoughts with the world, using these visual art forms. I want to be recognized for my work.
 <br>
I am most knowledgeable with Unity and C#. <br>
I am currently learning Python. <br>
 <br>
